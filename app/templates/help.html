                                  <li><strong>What is bitcoin mining:</strong> Bitcoin mining is the process of validating the information in a blockchain block by generating a cryptographic solution that matches specific criteria. When a correct solution is reached, a reward in the form of bitcoin and fees for the work done is given to the miner(s) who reached the solution first.</li>

                        <p>After doing a recharge, the next action will be buy a machine. This typically means that you make a subscription to our package offer(s), where we rent you server space in our mining machines and then we pay you as the mining process advances. Please note that it is hard to specify the exact amount of money that any machine can make while mining because the machine has to make correct predictions on complex progressive mathematical equations in order for you to earn money. However we have averaged the total daily income each machine makes per day and evaluated the amount we can pay you each day without making losses. Below is a table with all the machines you can buy.</p>

                        <p>After purchasing a machine, claims are how you tell us that you need the money made from subscriptions. You can decide to make claims from after 24 hours since the machine purchase or your last claim. This means that even if you don't do any claim until the machine subscription expires, we will still give you all of your money on your next claim.</p>
                        <p>
                            Claiming has very little actions to take.
